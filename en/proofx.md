### **1.**&#x42;ackground and Vision

In an era where computing power has become a core global resource, **NodeX** is committed to enabling every real device to securely join the blockchain and receive fair value returns in distributed networks.

However, current Web3 node networks commonly face two major challenges:

* **Proliferation of fake nodes (Sybil attacks)**: A single user can forge multiple identities and fabricate numerous nodes.
* **Ineffective computing power receiving rewards:** Nodes cannot prove they genuinely execute tasks, leading to token economic inflation and trust collapse.

To address this, NodeX proposes **ProofX (Authentic Identity Verification Mechanism)**, which reconstructs the authenticity verification system of distributed computing networks through a "device-centric, identity as trust anchor" approach, ensuring that every unit of computing power originates from independent and trustworthy physical devices.

### 2.System Architecture Overview

As the foundational trust core of NodeX's four-layer architecture, **ProofX** supports the security and verification of the entire computing network:

| Layer                      | Functional Positioning    | Core Content                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Device Layer**           | Node Perception           | Collects device fingerprints, performance benchmarks, and behavioral characteristics to generate unique Machine ID (MID) |
| **Coordination Layer**     | Task Scheduling           | Unified management of task allocation, network access, and node status synchronization                                   |
| **Trust Layer**            | Authenticity Verification | With ProofX as the core, verifies the authenticity of device computing power and behavior                                |
| **Financialization Layer** | Incentive Settlement      | Maps genuine contributions to points and token weights, establishing a trustworthy value distribution model              |

### 3.ProofX: Authentic Identity Verification Mechanism

#### 3.1 Core Objective

The goal of **ProofX** is to establish a **device-level authenticity verification standard**, ensuring that every node is an independent, verifiable, and continuously online real device.\
It serves as the "trust gateway" for the entire NodeX network.

#### 3.2 Verification Logic

**（1）Machine Unique Identity (MID) Generation and Binding**

* Upon initial registration, each device generates an **MID** based on hardware hash, device fingerprint, and signature algorithms.
* MID is the permanent identity of that device in the network, used for all subsequent verification, settlement, and risk control processes.
* MID is non-transferable and non-replicable, representing only "one genuinely operating device."

**（2）Random and Periodic Verification**

* The system periodically or randomly sends **Challenge tasks**, requiring devices to respond in real-time.
* If a device fails to pass verification promptly, its computing power recognition and task scheduling eligibility will be suspended.

**（3）Anti-Fraud and Penalty Mechanism**

If a node submits abnormal results, duplicate characteristics, or suspected forgery, the system will automatically trigger penalties:

* Reputation score decay;
* Points and earnings reset to zero;
* Permanent ban for severe cases.

***

### 4.Security and Scalability

* **Tamper-proof upload:** All client data is signed based on MID.
* **Privacy protection:** MID is completely separated from personal information, only reflecting device-level technical identity.
* **Modular architecture**: ProofX supports independent upgrades and replacements, flexibly accommodating different types of device environments.

***

### 5.Summary

**ProofX** is the trust foundation of the NodeX ecosystem,Through the mechanism of "authentic device identity + dynamic verification + secure binding"，it establishes a verifiable, auditable, and sustainable identity layer standard in distributed computing networks.

This not only ensures the genuine source of every unit of computing power,but also provides the most fundamental Trust Anchor for DePIN and future computing power markets.
