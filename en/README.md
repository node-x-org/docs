# About NodeX

<p align="right"><a href="https://docs.node-x.xyz/">中文</a></p>

**Summary:** NodeX turns global devices into a verifiable, AI-callable execution layer — the AI Body.NodeX is a global decentralized compute network that virtualizes servers, PCs, GPUs, mobile phones, IoT devices, and edge hardware into a unified, **verifiable Real-World Execution Layer callable by AI**.The core mission of NodeX is to build a new form of infrastructure for AI:

#### **the AI Body — a distributed execution system enabling AI to perform tasks, allocate resources, and take real actions.**

Cloud gives AI a superhuman brain. **NodeX gives AI a coordinated distributed body.**&#x54;hrough verifiable computation, capability abstraction, machine identity, and a global device marketplace, AI agents can safely and reliably access real device capabilities beyond the limits of cloud-only inference.

## **1. Why NodeX (and Why AI Needs a Body)**

**Summary:** Modern AI has intelligence but lacks real-world action capabilities; NodeX fills this gap.Modern AI systems (LLMs, SLMs, Agents) demonstrate exceptional cognition but lack fundamental abilities:

* cannot autonomously operate real devices
* cannot access cameras, sensors, or edge nodes
* cannot execute tasks on user-side machines
* cannot verify whether external nodes performed real work
* cannot access real-world I/O channels
* cannot affect environments like true autonomous systems

In short:

> **AI has intelligence, but no ability to act.**

DeepMind’s _Virtual Agent Economies (VAE)_ states:

> _Agent economies cannot exist unless AI can interact with a trustworthy real-world execution layer._

NodeX provides this missing layer —

#### **the AI Body Layer**,

built from global devices that are callable, verifiable, priced, and manageable.

## **2. How NodeX Builds the AI Body**

**Summary:** The AI Body is a multi-layer system combining devices, capabilities, execution, and verification.The AI Body is not a robot or a single device.It is a complete distributed system:

#### **AI Body = Devices + Capabilities + Execution + Verification**

NodeX supports all four pillars.

***

## **2.1 Device Layer**

**Summary:** Any device can join and provide physical resources to AI.Devices that can join NodeX:

* servers
* personal PCs
* GPUs
* smartphones
* IoT devices
* home NAS
* cameras
* edge compute nodes

These devices form **AI’s muscles and organs**.

***

## &#x20;**2.2 Capability Layer**

**Summary:** Devices expose standardized abilities to AI.Each device registers its abilities into the **NodeX Capability Registry**, such as:

* `compute.run`
* `shell.exec`
* `camera.capture`
* `sensor.read`
* `model.inference`
* `storage.write`

These collectively serve as **AI’s hands, eyes, and nervous system**.

***

## **2.3 Execution Layer**

**Summary:** NodeX provides a unified interface for AI to execute tasks across global devices.Unified API:

```
POST /v1/jobs {
  capability,
  input,
  selector
}
```

AI agents and developers can execute tasks on global devices through this interface.This forms **AI’s action system**.

***

## **2.4 Verification Layer**

**Summary:** AI must trust devices before using them; NodeX provides the trust framework.NodeX ensures device trustworthiness:

* **ProofX** — authenticity & baseline capability
* **PoRW** — proof of real work
* **RP/AP** — reputation scoring
* **MID** — persistent machine identity

This is **AI’s immune and safety system**.

***

## **3. Why the AI Body Matters**

**Summary:** Autonomous AI systems require a real execution substrate to perceive, act, and cooperate.AI is moving toward becoming **Autonomous Systems**, requiring:

* perception
* execution
* feedback
* coordination
* trust
* auditability

All of this depends on having a **distributed physical-digital body**.NodeX solves the key limitations identified in VAE:

| VAE Challenge             | NodeX (AI Body) Solution |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| AI cannot act             | Global capabilities      |
| No verifiable execution   | PoRW + ProofX            |
| No machine identity       | MID + RP/AP              |
| No trusted compute market | C2C marketplace          |
| Cloud cannot scale        | Global device network    |

AI is trained in the cloud.&#x20;

**AI acts through NodeX.**

## **4. The NodeX AI Body Stack (6-Layer Architecture)**

**Summary:** NodeX is a composable distributed execution network for AI.NodeX forms a distributed **AI Body Protocol Stack**:

1. **Device Layer**
2. **Capability Layer**
3. **Trust Layer**
4. **Execution Layer**
5. **Settlement Layer**
6. **Application Layer**

NodeX is not a single tool —it is a modular, programmable execution network for the AI era.

## **5. NodeX Products That Power the AI Body**

**Summary:** NodeHub, TaskPad, and the C2C marketplace form the operational backbone of the AI Body.

#### **NodeHub**

Entry point of the AI Body: device onboarding, capability mapping, verification, scheduling, telemetry.

#### **TaskPad**

Task and script ecosystem: community-contributed “action modules” that AI can execute through devices.

#### **C2C Marketplace**

The economic system of the AI Body: verifiable, priced device capabilities for agents and developers.

## 6. NodeX Value Proposition

(AI Body = Next-Generation Infrastructure)\*\* **Summary:** NodeX unlocks real-world action for AI, sustainable income for devices, and verifiable outputs for projects.\*\*NodeX addresses the most critical gaps of future AI systems:

* AI is no longer limited to cloud inference
* AI can take real-world actions for the first time
* AI can call real devices and pay for capabilities
* Devices earn income for contributing real work
* Projects/agents receive verifiable execution results

NodeX enables:

#### **A global network of devices functioning as the AI Body — coordinated, verifiable, and programmable.**

***

## **7. Vision**

**Summary:** NodeX aims to become the global execution layer of the AI agent economy.NodeX’s long-term vision:

* build a global execution layer for AI (AI Body Layer)
* create a sustainable income layer for devices (Machine Income Layer)
* provide trusted infrastructure for the AI agent economy
* establish an open, transparent, verifiable compute & capability market
* scale AI from cloud intelligence to real-world action

The future of AI requires more than computation —

#### **it requires a trustworthy, secure, and scalable body.**

NodeX is building that body.
