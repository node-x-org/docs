#### • **NodeHub**

A node and script management platform designed for the decentralized ecosystem.\
It enables users to connect devices across platforms, batch-deploy and manage blockchain nodes and automation scripts, and build a unified compute collaboration network.\
NodeHub also encourages creators to publish commands, fostering a community-driven script economy.

**Core Capabilities:**

* One-click deployment & batch task execution
* Real-time node monitoring & resource scheduling
* A shared ecosystem for commands & scripts
* A decentralized task distribution layer that connects DePIN projects with developers

**NodeHub** is a key infrastructure component for building the **PurpleCore community** and the **Node-X compute network**.
