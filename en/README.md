## NodeX: Make Any Device On-Chain, Make Compute Social

NodeX Labs, Inc. is a Web3 infrastructure innovation platform driven by the vision of "Make Any Device On-Chain, Make Compute Social." Through the deep integration of NaaS & NodeHub, DePIN, and AI computing power economy, it provides a one-stop solution for node deployment, computing power management, and monitoring. Leveraging AI algorithms for optimized scheduling, ProofX verification mechanisms, C2C trading markets, and node computing power pools, the platform is accelerating the on-chain integration of all things and the socialization of computing power, becoming a core gateway in the era of Web3 and AI convergence.



## NodeX primarily includes the following core products and services:

***

#### • **NodeHub**(Decentralized Computing Power Coordination Platform)

NodeHub is NodeX's infrastructure platform that connects idle computing resources worldwide to build an open and transparent decentralized computing power network.

It supports users in connecting devices across platforms, batch deployment and management of blockchain nodes and automated scripts, building a unified computing power collaboration network. NodeHub also encourages creators to publish commands, driving the script economy and community co-construction.

**Core Capabilities:**

* **Device Management and Verification**\
  Users connect devices through the client, and the system generates a unique device ID based on machine code. Periodic benchmark testing verifies the device's real computing power to prevent cheating behavior.
* **Community Command Marketplace**\
  Project teams and creators can publish deployment commands, allowing ordinary users to participate in Web3 projects with one-click execution. The client automatically completes deployment and continuously reports work logs.
* **Multi-device Collaboration**\
  Supports cross-platform management of multiple devices (PCs, servers, VPS, etc.), batch deployment and task execution.
* **Computing Power Market**\
  Integrates resources from Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, and multiple IDC GPU data centers to build a B2C computing market. Verified devices can set their own prices independently, and users freely choose computing power resources based on performance, reliability, and cost.

***

#### • **NaaS (Node-as-a-Service)**

NaaS provides one-click node deployment solutions, enabling users to easily participate in Web3 networks.

**Core Services:**

* **One-click Deployment Service**\
  Technical automation deployment allows non-technical users to quickly launch nodes.
* **Node Academy**\
  Has integrated multiple Web3 projects (including 0G, Boundless, NEXUS, Story, etc.), continuously providing node opportunities for users.
* **Business Synergy**\
  Achieves optimized resource utilization through NaaS & NodeHub collaborative cooperation. NodeHub will build B2C and C2C computing power markets, where NaaS can invoke computing power resources from this market for order deployment and use NodeHub's commands to complete order processing. In this process, NaaS acts as a user of NodeHub, able to directly publish computing tasks for Web3 and AI projects in the project-driven task market, further promoting a closed loop of the internal computing economy.

***

#### • **PoRW Chain**

Based on an EMA dynamic scoring model, comprehensively evaluating hardware performance, uptime, task completion rate, and execution efficiency. Converts real computing contributions into verifiable on-chain reputation, ensuring only verified real work receives rewards.

***

#### **NodeX Vision**

NodeX builds an open and transparent decentralized computing power ecosystem through its two core products: NodeHub and NaaS.
