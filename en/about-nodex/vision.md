### Background

The global computing power landscape is undergoing dramatic transformation:

**Computing Power Waste:**

* GPUs are scarce and expensive with low utilization rates (20-30% daily usage).
* Data center servers are over-provisioned with idle rates as high as 50%.
* Personal devices (PCs, laptops, phones—over 8 billion globally) lie dormant, lacking monetization channels.

**Web3 Airdrop Crisis:**

* Project teams cannot confirm genuine contributors; on-chain data inflation is severe.
* Sybil attacks (fake accounts) occur frequently, causing imbalance in token distribution ecosystems.
* Trust between users and project teams has broken down; anti-farming has become the norm (later-stage profit compression), hindering participation.

Centralized cloud services (such as AWS, holding 50% market share) are inefficient, monopolistic, and exclusive, wasting trillions of FLOPS in computing power and limiting the implementation of AI, DePIN, and RWA. The 2025 DePIN market is valued at $17.9 billion with 1,500+ active projects (such as Helium's million hotspots and io.net's 90% cost reduction), providing a historic opportunity for decentralized computing power.

### NodeX's Vision

**Make Any Devices On-Chain. Make Compute Social.** **The foundation of AI, DePIN and RWA.**

Bringing Everything On-Chain, Making Computing Social, Becoming the Foundation for AI, DePIN, and RWA

NodeX is committed to building decentralized computing power infrastructure. Through NodeHub, it aggregates millions/tens of millions of devices (GPUs, servers, PCs, phones), compatible with any model. WorkLog verifies genuine contributions through Web3 signatures (DID + private keys), driving C2C markets on-chain (L2 blockchain), empowering users with dual rewards (task returns + POC points). AI scheduling matches heterogeneous devices, the community command marketplace drives collaboration, community challenges eliminate fraud, challenging centralized cloud monopolies to build a user-owned global supercomputer.

### **NodeX's Mission**

* **Empowering Users:** Enable anyone to connect devices to the network and earn long-term rewards (POC points + task rewards).
* **Empowering Project Teams:** Provide genuine and trustworthy computing power contributions, ensuring a healthy distribution ecosystem.
* **Empowering the Industry:** Build decentralized computing power infrastructure to drive large-scale implementation of AI, DePIN, and RWA.
