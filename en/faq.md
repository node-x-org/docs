# FAQ

Here’s the translation of your FAQs for Node-X into English:

1. **Why run a node?**\
   Nodes are crucial for the operation of blockchain networks. By running a node, users contribute to the security, decentralization, and stability of the network. Additionally, users who participate in node deployment may be eligible for airdrop rewards from projects. Currently, projects like Aptos, Celestia, and Avail offer generous airdrop rewards to node operators.
2. **How is node revenue calculated?**\
   Nodes can be categorized into blockchain nodes and DePIN nodes. Blockchain nodes can earn block rewards (mining) and airdrop rewards, with block rewards being predictable based on coin prices and OTC rates, while airdrop rewards are uncertain. DePIN nodes usually generate income, but it depends on the project’s operations and strategies against attacks.
3. **Which projects have valuable nodes to run?**\
   We cannot predict which projects will yield significant returns; you need to conduct your own project research. However, Node-X performs internal reviews when launching projects, and you can consult the Node Academy for information about the founding team and investments to assess a project's potential. If you want us to support other nodes, you can submit a request, and we will introduce new services based on user feedback.
4. **How long does it take to run a node and receive rewards?**\
   The runtime for a node varies based on the project, hardware, and network conditions, making precise estimation difficult. Generally, nodes need to run until the project’s mainnet goes live to receive rewards, and the specific timing depends on the project's progress and the services you choose.
5. **What Services Does Node-X Provide?**
   1. **NaaS (Node-as-a-Service)** is a fully managed node service designed for users with no technical expertise, offering one-click deployment and professional operation and maintenance support, enabling anyone to easily participate in blockchain network development.
   2. **NodeHub**: Connects project teams, technical users, developers, and compute providers. It enables cross-device bulk deployment and execution of complex command tasks. In conjunction with the PoRW consensus, it is building the world’s largest decentralized computing task base chain.
6. **Can one server run multiple nodes simultaneously?**\
   Whether multiple nodes can run depends on server performance and project requirements. Some projects (like ALEO mining) may use all server resources, preventing compatibility with other nodes. If resources are sufficient, multiple nodes with lower resource demands can be deployed simultaneously.
7. **How does Node-X charge?**\
   Node-X adopts an innovative charging model, only charging for node installation and operational maintenance fees. You can commission us to purchase servers or manage your servers, allowing us to deploy as many nodes as possible based on the server's capabilities to maximize resource utilization.
8. **How is security ensured?**\
   Due to the specific nature of some node projects, it may be necessary to provide wallet private keys for node operation. In such cases, Node-X employs advanced encryption technology to secure private keys during custody. Our private key management is entirely automated, with no human intervention, ensuring your private keys remain secure throughout the process. After node operations are completed, users will safely receive their private keys. We commit to strictly safeguarding private keys during custody to maximize the protection of your assets.
9.  **Can I deploy nodes myself?**\
    You can connect your own server to NodeHub, or directly purchase a server on NodeHub. Once connected or purchased, you can deploy and run nodes on your own.

    You need to prepare computing resources and network environment that meet the project requirements (such as CPU/GPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth).
10. **How can I check the node's operational status?**\
    NodeHub provides real-time logs and a monitoring dashboard, allowing you to check whether your node is executing tasks properly and whether there are any errors or anomalies.
