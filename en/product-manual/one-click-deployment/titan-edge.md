### 2.Fill in Titan Parameters

1. **Provide Identity Code**

You need to fill in your identification code, then place an order to purchase:\
Obtain information and fill in:

Obtain the relevant information and upload it. The entire process is encrypted and transmitted securely without human intervention, ensuring safety. <mark style="color:red;">Multiple nodes can be provided with just one identity code.</mark> [Get your identity code from the official Titan website](https://titannet.gitbook.io/titan-network-cn/zi-yuan-wang-luo-ce-shi/bang-ding-shen-fen-ma#ru-he-shen-qing-shen-fen-ma)!

### 3.Wait for service and check the official dashboard

After a successful purchase, Node-X will deploy the Titan node for you. This process usually takes place within 24 hours. You can instantly check the node status via the following methods:

1. **Check node status:**\
   In the Node-X platform user panel, you can view all the purchased nodes and their current status.
2. **Project Dashboard View:**\
   Once the node configuration is complete, you can visit the project-provided [dashboard URL](https://test1.titannet.io/) to view detailed node information.

## **Conclusion**

Deploying a Titan node via the Node-X platform is that simple! Hope this guide is helpful to you.\
