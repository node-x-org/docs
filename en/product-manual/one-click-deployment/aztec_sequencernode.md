## How to deploy a Aztec Sequencer node via the Node-X platform?

### 1.Obtain a Node-X account and deploy a node

First, you need a Node-X account. If you donâ€™t have one, please go to [the Node-X registration page](https://node-x.xyz/) to register.

  This wallet must contain at least 0.1 Sepolia ETH.
*   **Fill in the RPC endpointsFill in the RPC endpoints**\
    You need to obtain two RPCs: one for ETH Sepolia RPC and another for ETH Sepolia Beacon.

    Paid RPC endpoints are required if free RPC request limits are insufficient.\
    We recommend purchasing our self-hosted RPCs.\
    You can obtain the RPC endpoints for both ETH Sepolia Beacon and ETH Sepolia chains from [znkr.](https://www.ankr.com/)
* **Fill in the Aztec wallet address**\
  [Download the Aztec wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/azguard-wallet/pliilpflcmabdiapdeihifihkbdfnbmn), create a wallet, and then obtain the wallet address.

After a successful purchase, Node-X will deploy the Aztec Sequencer node for you. This process usually takes place within 24 hours. You can instantly check the node status via the following methods:

1. **Check node status:**\
   In the Node-X platform user panel, you can view all the purchased nodes and their current status.

## **Conclusion**

Deploying a Aztec Sequencer node via the Node-X platform is that simple! Hope this guide is helpful to you.\
