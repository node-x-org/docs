### 2.Fill in the parameters

1. **EVM Wallet Private Key**: In your EVM wallet, you need to choose one of the following three networks: eth-sepolia, base-mainnet, or base-sepolia. Then, you must have a certain amount of ETH (default is 0.1ETH) and at least 6 USDC on the selected network. Of course, you can deposit more if you wish. Currently, the official recommendation is to use the Base mainnet, so it is advised to deposit at least 6 USDC on the Base mainnet in your wallet.

### 3.Wait for service and check the official dashboard

After a successful purchase, Node-X will deploy the Aztec Validator node for you. This process usually takes place within 24 hours. You can instantly check the node status via the following methods:
