### 1.Obtain a Node-X account and deploy a node

First, you need a Node-X account. If you donâ€™t have one, please go to [the Node-X registration page](https://node-x.xyz/) to register. After registration, follow the steps below to purchase and upload resources to deploy the node. The following is the order placement process using the 0G Alignment Node as an example:

### 2.Fill in the parameters

* **Fill in the EVM wallet private key**\
  This wallet must contain at least 0.1 Sepolia ETH.
*   **Fill in the RPC endpointsFill in the RPC endpoints**\
    You need to obtain two RPCs: one for ETH Sepolia RPC and another for ETH Sepolia Beacon.

    Paid RPC endpoints are required if free RPC request limits are insufficient.\
    We recommend purchasing our self-hosted RPCs.\
    You can obtain the RPC endpoints for both ETH Sepolia Beacon and ETH Sepolia chains from [znkr.](https://www.ankr.com/)

### 3.Wait for service and check the official dashboard

After a successful purchase, Node-X will deploy the Aztec Prover node for you. This process usually takes place within 24 hours. You can instantly check the node status via the following methods:

1. **Check node status:**\
   In the Node-X platform user panel, you can view all the purchased nodes and their current status.

## **Conclusion**

Deploying a Aztec Prover node via the Node-X platform is that simple! Hope this guide is helpful to you.\
