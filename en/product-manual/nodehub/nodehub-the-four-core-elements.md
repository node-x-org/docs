### **1) ProofX (Device Authentication)**

**What it is:**\
A verification mechanism that confirms the connected device is real and meets performance requirements.

**What it solves:**\
Fake hardware configurations.

**How it works:**\
The client automatically checks hardware fingerprints, environment integrity, and benchmark consistency.\
Only verified devices move to the next step.

**What you see:**\
Dashboard status: **“ProofX: Passed / Failed.”**

***

### **2) MID (Machine ID — Unique Device Identity)**

**What it is:**\
A one-device-one-ID certificate issued after passing ProofX — your device’s “on-chain identity card.”

**What it solves:**\
Ensures all scoring, settlement, and risk control are uniquely bound and fully traceable to _one specific device_.

**Rules:**\
Non-transferable, non-duplicable; abnormal behavior may lead to lower trust or freezing.

**What you see:**\
Your device’s **MID number** on the dashboard.

***

### **3) RP (Resource Points — Device Contribution Score)**

**What it is:**\
A long-term scoring system that measures your device’s resource contribution.

**Where it comes from:**\
Devices with a valid MID accumulate RP daily based on stable online performance.

**Scoring highlights:**

* Multi-factor weighting: CPU 25%｜GPU 35%｜RAM 12%｜ROM 13%｜NET 15%
* Standardization & caps prevent “extreme hardware dominance.”
* Stability, uptime, low error rate → better long-term RP.
* Daily emission cap + semiannual halving to control inflation.

**What you see:**\
**Today’s RP / Total RP**

### **4) AP (Action Points — Account Participation Score)**

**What it is:**\
A scoring system measuring user behavior and participation (not device power).

**Where it comes from:**\
Learning quizzes, governance votes, missions, content creation, invitations, etc.

**Purpose:**\
Encourages human contribution and community engagement.\
You can earn AP _even without_ a device.

**What you see:**\
**Today’s AP / Weekly AP**

## **Standard Workflow (3 Steps)**

1. **Connect device → System verification**
2. **Pass ProofX → Receive MID (one device, one ID)**
3. **Device earns RP (compute)｜Account earns AP (actions)**

**Memory trick:**\
Border check (ProofX) → Get your badge (MID) → Machine earns RP｜Human earns AP

***

## **What You Can Gain**

#### **If you have a device:**

ProofX → MID → Continuous RP accumulation,\
Plus AP through tasks and participation — boosting dual contributions.

#### **If you don’t have a device:**

Earn AP through tasks first;\
Later you may buy/rent an instance in the marketplace and then go through ProofX → MID → RP.

## **FAQ**

**Q1: Can I get an MID without passing ProofX?**\
A: No. MID is issued _only_ after ProofX verification.

**Q2: Can I earn RP without a device?**\
A: No. RP is device-based and requires a valid MID.

**Q3: Is AP related to device performance?**\
A: No. AP only measures user actions and participation.

**Q4: Does high hardware configuration guarantee higher RP?**\
A: Not necessarily. RP uses standardization and caps; long-term stability and uptime matter more.

**Q5: Is RP more important than AP?**\
A: Both matter. **RP (resource)** + **AP (action)** together form your total contribution and will jointly influence mapping weight.

## **One-Sentence Summary**

**ProofX authenticates your device → MID assigns its identity → RP measures real compute → AP measures human participation.**\
**NodeHub creates a verifiable economy of real machines, real actions, and real rewards.**
