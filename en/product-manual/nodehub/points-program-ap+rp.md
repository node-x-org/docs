  AP + RP Dual Points Mechanism and ProofX Cold/Hot Reward Pool Adjustment
  System
---

# Points Program (AP+RP)

<p align="right">中文</p>

### 1.Design Intent

In the NodeX network, every device, every computing power unit, and every participant should receive **fair rewards** based on their **genuine contributions.**

Therefore, we have established a complete incentive system consisting of **ProofX + PoRW + AP/RP + cold/hot reward pool** adjustment,

ensuring a closed loop of "real devices → real computing power → real returns".

Core Philosophy:

**Incentivize genuine contributions and oppose false prosperity.**

### 2.ProofX: Trusted Device Verification Layer

ProofX is NodeX's **trusted computing verification protocol**, designed to ensure all nodes are real devices,preventing impersonation, device reuse, identity forgery, and other **Sybil attacks.**

**ProofX** verification includes:

|   |   |   |
| - | - | - |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |
