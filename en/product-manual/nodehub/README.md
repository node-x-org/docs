# NodeHub

**NodeHub** is a decentralized compute management and node collaboration platform under the **Node-X** ecosystem. It aims to aggregate idle and edge computing power globally, empowering Web3 users to access, deploy, and manage nodes with lower barriers and higher efficiency, while optimizing their rewards.

Our vision is to build a decentralized compute coordination network where **“access equals earnings”**, accelerating the **standardization** and **modularization** of Web3 node operations.

By combining a script creation community with AI-assisted capabilities, NodeHub is creating a full-cycle loop from **node deployment → intelligent scheduling → continuous incentivization**.

#### **Key Features**

**Performance Monitoring**\
After connecting your server to NodeHub, you can monitor its real-time performance, including CPU, memory, and network usage. The platform also monitors the operational status of all nodes, automatically notifies you in case of anomalies, and initiates recovery protocols—ensuring smart, unattended operations.

**Node Status Monitoring**\
View real-time operational status, health indicators, and uptime of each node.

**Multi-Device Coordination**\
Supports linking multiple VPS or edge devices under individual or organizational accounts.

**Command Script System**\
Open community for script creation and sharing. Enables automated, chain-style operations.

**Log Export & Task Reports**\
Supports data exports for task reconciliation, performance analysis, and operational insights.

**C2C Compute Marketplace (in development)**\
Users can contribute their idle compute power and earn rewards from platform-based tasks.

**Community Commands**\
NodeHub offers a rich collection of prebuilt node deployment scripts for popular Web3 projects. Deploy or update multiple servers simultaneously, or customize your own deployment commands for streamlined server management.

**AI Agent**\
The built-in AI Agent analyzes your server’s resource usage and recommends optimal node deployment strategies—helping you unlock the full potential of your hardware.

**Security Management**\
With multi-level access control, data encryption, and audit logging, NodeHub ensures node security and helps users meet compliance requirements.
