**1. Platform Infrastructure**

**1.1 User-Side Processes and Modules**

* **Server Hosting Functionality**\
  Users can connect their servers via SSH credentials or SSH keys. The platform will retrieve relevant hardware information, network status, and provide basic health monitoring and anomaly alerting features.
* **One-Click Node Application Installation**\
  Users can select application commands, input necessary parameters, and execute them with one click. The platform will automatically deploy applications, supporting batch operations to simplify management processes.
* **Security**\
  All user input data is encrypted and the platform does not store raw data. Encrypted data can only be decrypted by the user, ensuring privacy and security.
* **Custom Scripts**\
  Users can define custom scripts and execute them in batches to achieve unified management and operations across multiple nodes.
* **One-Stop Deployment**\
  After selecting the desired applications and deployment quantity, the platform automatically completes server purchasing, system initialization, configuration optimization, and node installation, delivering a fully automated deployment process.

**1.2 Backend Technologies and Functions**

* **Microservices Architecture**\
  The platform adopts a microservices architecture, modularizing features such as user management, server management, and node deployment for easier expansion and maintenance.
* **Command Authorization**\
  Strict authentication mechanisms ensure that users can only execute commands on authorized servers, preventing unauthorized operations.
* **CI/CD System**\
  Automated build, testing, and release processes ensure that node application images on the platform are updated to the latest versions.
* **Basic Monitoring and Alerts**\
  Real-time monitoring of node performance triggers automatic scaling or alerts, ensuring system stability and quick responses to anomalies.

**2. Data Collection and Management**

* **Server Status Data**\
  Collect hardware information and key metrics from hosted servers to provide optimization and recommendations for node applications.
* **Node Application Runtime Data**\
  Monitor resource usage, logs, and block synchronization progress of node applications to optimize deployment and installation processes.
* **User Profiles and Preferences**\
  Based on users' historical behaviors and preferences, the platform provides personalized deployment suggestions, improving efficiency and adaptability.
* **Data Storage Solutions**\
  Use relational databases for structured data storage and time-series databases (e.g., Elasticsearch) for logs and monitoring data, enhancing data processing efficiency.

***

**3. Community Commands**

* **Custom Commands by Creators**\
  Approved creators can write custom commands for installing, configuring, and managing node applications, which can then be shared with other users.
* **Command Sharing and Reviews**\
  Users can use shared community commands and participate in reviews and ratings. The platform continuously optimizes the quality of community commands based on user feedback.

**6. AI Agent 2.0**

* **Intelligent Resource Scheduling**\
  Automatically schedules resources and scales based on node load, server capacity, and real-time data, optimizing resource allocation.
* **Log and Anomaly Analysis**\
  Use machine learning models to predict system anomalies and trigger warnings, reducing fault risks.
* **Automated Maintenance Script Generation**\
  Use large language models to generate maintenance scripts, lowering the scripting threshold and improving operational efficiency.
* **Cross-Platform Knowledge Management**\
  Integrate more blockchain nodes and cloud services to enrich the knowledge base with diverse solutions.
* **Automated Testing and Verification**\
  Automatically generate test plans and validate node applications' compatibility and performance to ensure system stability.

***

**7. Model Training and Inference**

* **Data Collection and Cleaning**\
  Collect server monitoring data, node logs, and user behavior data, clean and preprocess them to ensure data quality.
* **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**\
