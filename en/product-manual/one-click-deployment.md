# One-Click Deployment

Node-X provides users with a friendly, efficient, and low-cost node hosting service. No coding knowledge is required to entrust us with node deployment and maintenance.

**Transparent Pricing:**\
All deployment fees consist of server costs, node installation fees, and maintenance fees, all clearly itemized.

**Flexible Billing:**\
We offer flexible pricing options, allowing you to pay on a daily subscription basis.

**Maximize Your Resources:**\
We offer server-based packages—for example, a fully configured 4090 GPU server can run nodes for up to 5 projects. We only charge installation and maintenance fees on this basis and leverage our strong supply chain integration to provide you with the lowest server prices.

**Custom Deployment:**\
If you wish to entrust your server operations to us, please fill out an application form, and we will provide dedicated deployment and maintenance services for you.
